### What is Lava?
The Lava Protocol aims to provide decentralized and scalable access to blockchain data through the use of a network of providers and consumers. It utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and incentivizes participants through the use of its native LAVA token. The protocol includes features such as a stake-weighted pseudorandom pairing function, backfilling, and a lazy settlement process to improve scalability and efficiency. The roadmap for the Lava Protocol includes further development of governance, conflict resolution, privacy, and quality of service, as well as support for additional API specifications. It is designed to be a public good that enables decentralized access to the Web3 ecosystem.
